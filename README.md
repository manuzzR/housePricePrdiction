# housePricePrdiction
In this project, we will predict the house price in a certain part of the city. First, we will explore the data using different packages from Python. Then, we will split the data into a test and train data set. Finally, we will use Sklearn to build the machine learning model using the training data set and testing it in our test data set. Here, we will test our machine model.
